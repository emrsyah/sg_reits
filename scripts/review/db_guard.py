"""db_guard.py — whole-database guard for the dev SGX REIT tables.

Runs every invariant the per-report gates cannot see, because they check one extraction at
a time and the defects that actually shipped were cross-row, cross-year or whole-column:

  ME8U FY2023 category never mapped through the aliases  (a per-report enum check passes:
      the raw label IS a valid string, just not a canonical one)
  basis_segment tagged on FY2024 but not FY2025          (needs a cross-year comparison)
  T82U trade_mix summing to 200%                         (needs the sum grouped by segment)
  percentages living on two scales at once               (needs a range check per column)
  the same transaction present in two report years       (needs a cross-report view)
  deal_id left grouping a single row                     (needs the final row set)

Checks raw (`sgx_reit_*`) and derived (`sgx_reit_*_final`). Prints every finding grouped by
severity and exits 1 if any FAIL. WARNs never fail the run.

Usage:
  python scripts/review/db_guard.py                 # everything
  python scripts/review/db_guard.py --only scale,enums
  python scripts/review/db_guard.py --list          # show group names
  python scripts/review/db_guard.py --quiet         # findings only, no PASS lines
